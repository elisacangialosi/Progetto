Sentiment analysis can be done as an inner join. Three sentiment lexicons are available via the get_sentiments() function. Letâ€™s look at the words with a joy score from the NRC lexicon. What are the most common joy words?

```{r}
library(tokenizers)
nrcjoy <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  filter(sentiment == "joy")

review_subject %>%
  semi_join(nrcjoy) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
bing <- get_sentiments("bing")

bing_words <- review_subject %>%
  inner_join(bing) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
bing_words %>%
  filter(n > 500) %>%
  mutate(n = ifelse(sentiment == "negative", -n, n)) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment")
```
