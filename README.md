# Text Analysis of Hotel Reviews from Booking.com

In this report I perform text analysis of the publicly available review data posted on Booking for for the major turistic italian cities: Milan, Rome, Florence Venice and Verona. A scraper of reviews has been performed from bookingâ€™s website. A subset of the dataset containing only english and italian reviews has been then analyzed. 

After reshaping the dataset in order to format dates properly, the analysis focuses on Natural Language Processing techniques to break the text into n-gram tokens (n ranging from 1-2), which basically means breaking the text reviews into n-word combinations called monogram (n=1) and bigram (n=2). 
This has been done to show the most commonly occurring words in English reviews. Then, a comparison with Italian reviews has been performed. 

Finally, I used text mining to approach the emotional content of text reviews, distinguishing between positive and negative words. In this way, I identified words that contribute to each sentiment.
